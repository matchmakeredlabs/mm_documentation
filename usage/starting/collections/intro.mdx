# Building Described Collections
The most essential step in using MatchMaker is in creating collections: a unique format enabling matching of knowledge across a variety of sources. As discussed in the introduction, collections are made up of elements.

In this section, we'll cover everything you need to know to create and describe a MatchMaker collection.
1. In [How to Create a Collection](/usage/starting/collections/create), we’ll learn how to create your first collection. 
2. In  [How to Build a Hierarchy](/usage/starting/collections/hierarchy), we’ll focus on elements as items with titles and descriptions and build out a hierarchy. 
3. In [How to Describe Elements](/usage/starting/collections/describe), we’ll focus on elements which contain no other elements and learn how to describe them for use in matches.
