# How to Describe Elements?

Now that you have established an excellent hierarchy for your collection, you are ready to begin describing its elements; that is, painting a description for each one using MatchMaker’s Palet<sup style={{fontSize: 8}}>TM</sup> statements!
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={DescribeIntro} width="60%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>

In this step, you will learn how to generate a Palet<sup style={{fontSize: 8}}>TM</sup> Key representing the intent of the element you are describing. This Palet Key is part of an element’s “Descriptor”, a fancy name for all the information attached to an element. This is where the magic of MatchMaker happens and enables all the powerful insights to be explored in the next section: [“How to Generate a Report?”](/usage/starting/report).

## Math Help: Describing the Math Help Collection
In an incredible escalation, Malia herself shows up to Math Help headquarters, begging for assistance with quadratic equations.. Mrs. MathHelp storms into your office (again), and demands that you get the quadratic equation’s section done YESTERDAY. Fortunately, you're not sweating it as MatchMaker makes this critical process easy. You start at the MatchMaker dashboard.
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={SelectDescribe} width="80%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
Press “Browse & Describe” to begin.
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={SearchCollections} width="80%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
Now, find your collection. Click on the field that says “Enter Keyword…” and type in “Math Help”, then press ENTER or “+ Filter” to search for the Math Help collection.
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={AnnotatedSearch} width="80%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
:::info
<div style={{color: "red", margin: 0, display: 'contents'}}>**1.**</div> How much of a collection has been described; we’re starting with an undescribed collection, so our collection is 0% described

<div style={{color: "red", margin: 0, display: 'contents'}}>**2.**</div> Our search query appears on top as a filter which can be removed by pressing the “x”

<div style={{color: "red", margin: 0, display: 'contents'}}>**3.**</div> The name of our collection; clicking on it allows us to view its elements and describe them
:::
Click on “Math Help’s Mathematical Resources” to view its elements and start describing them!
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={ExpandFirst} width="80%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
Currently, your hierarchy is collapsed, in this collection you can press “Expand” twice to fully display the elements of the collection.
:::tip
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={LegendGraphic} width="90%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
Don’t forget to use the shapes to guide you through the collection format. Elements with squares have no elements attached to them and can be described. Meanwhile, triangles represent elements which can be expanded to reveal others (and cannot be described). 
:::
### Describing our First Element
Begin by selecting the “Completing the Square” element; to do this, click on its name.
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={SelectStart} width="80%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={EditDescription} width="80%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
Now that the element is selected, press “Edit Description” to enter the describe view. There’s a lot going on this page, let’s break it down.
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={FindSelect} width="80%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
:::info
<div style={{color: "red", margin: 0, display: 'contents'}}>**1.**</div> This is your portal to the PaletTM, here you can search for the Palet statements that you’ll need to build a Palet key for your element, in essence, the little concepts you’ll need to combine to represent a full piece of information

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. You can search using three modes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Text: Simple text-based search will match with Palet statement descriptions

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. AI: The description of your element will be used as context in tandem with your search query

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. AI + Context: The description of your element as well as the hierarchy will be used in tandem with your search query

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Every Palet statement has an assigned unique identifying number (ID), a type, and a little piece of knowledge (its statement)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. The types are as follows:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Skills, Tools, Fact knowledge (STFk): concepts that underlie a discipline

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Conceptual Understanding (CU): High level concepts that often incorporate many different concepts and are organizationally essential to a discipline

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Process (P): a method of accomplishing a certain task

<div style={{color: "red", margin: 0, display: 'contents'}}>**2.**</div> Here is your element’s descriptor, which is all the information about your element. Here all of the Palet statements you select will go to build your Palet key
:::
Begin by scrolling down on the descriptor view on the right until you see a label at the bottom that says “Key”. This is your Palet key, and it will grow as you give it Palet statements. So, let's give it a first Palet statement! To do this, search for “Completing the Square” in Text mode and click on the magnifying glass.
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={StartFirstSearch} width="90%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
Once the magnifying glass is clicked, MatchMaker will search through the Palet for a matching Palet statement to “Completing the Square”, yielding the following result:
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={AddFirstStatement} width="70%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
This statement greatly helps describe your current lesson, hence, press the “+” icon to add it to our element’s Palet key.
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={FirstPaletStatement} width="65%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
Great, you have successfully added your first Palet statement! It now appears under the Palet key for “Completing the Square”, in essence, you’ve stated that this little piece of knowledge is addressed by this lesson. For simplicity’s sake, leave the element with just this Palet statement (this will lead to much worse matches but we must move quickly for Malia). Now, scroll back up on the Descriptor side until you see a “Save” button.
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={SaveFirstPaletKey} width="65%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
Click on it to save our changes, and congratulations! You’ve just described your first element, and begun painting a wonderful canvas of Math Help knowledge.
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={DescribeLegend} width="80%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
After saving our changes, the hierarchy has updated the icons next to elements to show that we have described “Completing the Square”(this can be seen after refreshing the page where we previewed our whole collection).
### Describing an Element by Text Search
Malia bangs again on the door, there’s no time to waste. Continue to your next element…conveniently, MatchMaker makes this quick.
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={DescriptorSwitching} width="65%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
:::info
<div style={{color: "red", margin: 0, display: 'contents'}}>**1.**</div> These arrows allow you to move to the next describable element in order of the hierarchy

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. ←: Go back up the hierarchy to the previous describable element

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. →: Go back down to the hierarchy to the next describable element

<div style={{color: "red", margin: 0, display: 'contents'}}>**2.**</div> We can choose to filter by undescribed elements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Keyless: Only move to elements which have no PaletTM key (are undescribed). This makes quick work of moving to the next element while you are in the process of describing them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. All: View all elements, those that have already been described and those that have not. This is particularly useful when reviewing descriptions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Note: Since we have only described this element, there is no change in behavior if this is on or off at the moment
:::
Press the right arrow (→) to move onto the next element down the hierarchy (“Quadratic Form”). 
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={SecondElement} width="60%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
Go ahead and search for all “quadratic” Palet statements. Since this is a more general element, there are going to be many more fits for “Quadratic Form” than “Completing the Square”. You’ve worked for a long time at Math Help so it should be easy to find Palet statements ...psst, pick these ones out of your search for quadratic:
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={DeleteStatement} width="50%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
Oh no! Quadratic form has nothing to do with soil or with rodents…press “-” to delete that Palet statement from the Palet key (or any others you may need to get rid of).
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={IncompleteSecondKey} width="50%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
Excellent, now you have an effective larger Palet key! Hopefully you’re starting to get into practice; however, don't fret if you’re confused, watch the video at the end for the step-by-step process.
#### Central vs Peripheral Palet Statements
You have a solid Palet<sup style={{fontSize: 8}}>TM</sup> key for “Quadratic Form”, but some of these statements don’t quite fit Math Helps resources. As you know, Mrs. Math Help loves to touch on some broader topics in Math Help resources, while keeping things pretty simple. However, it would be wrong to ignore Mrs. Math Help’s addition of some broader learning on this topic. Don’t worry, MatchMaker has a system to handle this. Every Palet statement can be marked as either <u>central</u> or <u>peripheral</u>. For example, a lesson on how to cook scrambled eggs covers the process of cracking eggs, very directly, that is, it is a <u>central</u> topic. However, the addition of oil or how to use a spatula isn’t likely directly taught or even the focus of the lesson; but it is covered to a degree. Therefore, that is a <u>peripheral</u> concept in that lesson. 
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={DecentralKey} width="60%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
In “Quadratic Form”, “identifying functions as linear, exponential, quadratic, absolute value, logarithmic, or rational” is never explicitly discussed, but is related to the topics at hand, and covered to a degree. Therefore, let’s mark this statement as peripheral. We do this by unchecking the circled box above under the “Cen” or <u>central</u> label, therefore marking it as <u>peripheral</u>.
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={CompleteSecondKey} width="60%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
Now, scroll up and press save!
### Using IDs to Describe an Element 
Press the right arrow (→) to move onto the next element (“Factoring Quadratic Equations”) and let’s give it the following Palet<sup style={{fontSize: 8}}>TM</sup>  key.
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={ThirdKey} width="60%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
This may be a little tedious, feel free to use the “Id” for each Palet statement to search it up. For example, to get the first Palet statement, you could search for the following:
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={IDSearch} width="60%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
Feel free to repeat this process for each Palet statement. Once you’re done, don’t forget to scroll up and hit save!
### Describing a Complex Element
Go ahead and press the right arrow (→) to move onto the last element (“Graphing Quadratic Equations”). As you may remember from school, this is actually a pretty big topic. Graphing Quadratic Equations touches on many different bits of knowledge; you need to know how to graph a function, convert the equation to an easy form, and more. You may also have elements like this in the future, it’s helpful to remember the upcoming process we’re going to use for this. 
Let's begin by performing a search for the topic and its related items; and you’ll find lots and lots of matches. For this exercise, you will add anything that even remotely fits, and then, once you are done gathering PaletTM statements, you will remove whatever fits worst. To go back to the metaphor of color, you will go to the artist's palette, get many colors, then see how they mix together and return the ones that don’t quite fit. If you remember some math, this is a very useful example to try on our own. Some good search queries to use are: “parabola”, and the name of an element is never a bad bet, “Graphing Quadratic Equations”. 

Otherwise, don’t fret, here is a Palet key that fits well:
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={FirstThirdKey} width="50%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
<img src={SecondThirdKey} width="50%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
<img src={ThirdThirdKey} width="50%" alt="The documentation hierarchy is shown"/>
</div>
Palet keys can get quite large, as conceptually larger topics are described. However, it is best to keep them bigger rather than smaller in order to create the most detailed and insightful elements. Go ahead and scroll up to press “Save” and you are all done (verify this by pressing → and receiving an error message that there are no more elements below).

:::tip 
When generating the hierarchy of your Collection, it is best that the elements at the lowest level not be too conceptually broad otherwise the resulting matches will also be less specific. 
:::
## Conclusion
You did it! You completed your first collection; certainly Mrs. Math Help and Malia will be grateful. Don’t worry if this was overwhelming, this was just an example collection, and MatchMaker becomes increasingly more intuitive with practice, and especially when you create a real collection. 
{/* If you have any more questions, feel free to take a look at the below video.
(video is currently partially complete) */}
Otherwise, if you’re ready to keep going and see the real magic of MatchMaker now that you’ve done the heavy lifting, move on to [“How to Generate a Report?”](/usage/starting/report).
