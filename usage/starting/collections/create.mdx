## Math Help: Creating a Learning Resources Collection
To tap into MatchMaker’s repository of mathematical competencies or curriculum standards, Math Help tasks you with creating a collection for their learning resource. To do this, fill out the fields as such:  
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img  src={MathHelpCollection?.src || MathHelpCollection} width="60%" alt="A collection preview is displayed"/>
</div>
Finally, create this collection by either pressing the “Create Collection” (yellow) or “Create and Edit Collection” (green). “Create Collection” will simply create your collection, meanwhile, “Create and Edit Collection” will create your collection and take you to the edit page to build your collection. Press the green button: “Create and Edit Collection”, in the next section, you will learn what to do next, that is: [How to Build a Hierarchy?](/usage/starting/collections/hierarchy)
