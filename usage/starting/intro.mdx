# Welcome to MatchMaker Education Labs, PBC
Thank you for joining MatchMaker Education Labs, Public Benefit Corporation (MMEdLabs, PBC) on our mission to liberate learning! We're excited to introduce you to the MatchMaker  platform (MM) and quickly get you up to speed. For more in-depth information, start with [Login and Dashboard](/usage/vocab/login_dash) to get a breakdown of each MatchMaker feature.
## What is MatchMaker?
MatchMaker is revolutionary new technology enabling meaningful, valid and reliable matches between learning assets, competency frameworks, and curricula. MatchMaker has been used in higher education, HR, personal skill growth, and much more. With MatchMaker, gone are the days of wasting time relearning or sitting with uncertainty in knowledge!
### Malia: A Struggling Student
Introducing Malia: a 9th grader who is struggling with solving quadratic equations in Algebra 1, and wants to find resources for help. Malia decides to ask the instructor, who refers them to Math Help, a MatchMaker enabled website. Drawing from MatchMaker's description of the standard Algebra 1 curriculum implemented at Malia's school, the Math Help search identifies resources that address Malia’s specific knowledge gaps with respect to solving quadratic equations. 
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img  src={MatchExample} width="60%" alt="A page with one item on the left: 'Solving Quadratic Equations'. On the other side, matches with this item are shown from the educational resources on the site, ranked by their Match percentage"/>
</div>
By utilizing the pages referred, Malia quickly masters quadratic equations and confidently carries on with the class.We will now peel back the curtain here and see how Math Help accomplished this using Matchmaker. You will take the role of a Math Help employee working under Mrs. Math Help (Math Help CEO) and this will serve as the guiding example of this “Getting Started” section. Since we have all learned (and likely struggled with) Math at some point, this should hopefully be quite intuitive. Of course, your organization will very likely carry a different context to math, but these lessons are quite applicable to any MatchMaker workflow, so carry on and sooner, rather than later, you will be ready to Liberate Learning!

## How does MatchMaker work? 
### The Power of Collections
MatchMaker's power is enabled by a novel and intuitive architecture for storing learning assets, competency-based frameworks, and curriculums. This architecture generalizes all of these items into what are known as __collections__. Let's take this documentation and turn it into a collection! 
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={ElementsIntro} width="43%" alt="Inside each collection sits elements which are made up of two colors which mix to create the collection's color"/>
</div>
In the figure above, this section of documentation is organized into a collection. Collections consist of elements, which are organized in a hierarchy. At the moment, there are only two elements: "Introduction", organized under the "Getting Started" element. Notice that "Introduction" has a particular color within the collection: green. In color theory, it is always possible to create a color out of a sum of others. In MatchMaker, this principle is applied to knowledge. Therefore, upon looking closer, this green is actually made up of a mix of blue and yellow. In essence, the overall color, green, represents exactly what this introduction section teaches, but the green has been split up into two pieces which combine to fully represent the whole. This is where the real magic of MatchMaker lies, as each element at the bottom of a hierarchy must be made of different components from what is called the Palet<sup style={{fontSize: 8}}>TM</sup>.

### What is the Palet?
The Palet<sup style={{fontSize: 8}}>TM</sup> is a MatchMaker maintained database of little bits of knowledge you can use to describe any piece of learning material. The Palet enables many of the innovations of MatchMaker, and is the backbone of all matches between items. Each tiny piece of knowledge in the Palet is referred to as a Palet statement, and an element's unique combination of Palet statements is called a Palet key. Think of the Palet as the many different colors you can choose from to paint your elements, a Palet statement as a particular color, and a Palet key as a particular art piece you make from a choice of colors. 
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={PaletIntro} width="50%" alt="Metaphors for the terms are described visually: The Palet as an artists Palette, A Palet Statement as a particular color, and a Palet Key as a variety of colors"/>

## What's next?
Now that you're up to speed with the basics of MatchMaker, we will now explore the MatchMaker interface as an employee of the fictional Math Help company! Credentialed either by your employer or by Matchmaker, navigate to MatchMaker's login page and we'll begin!
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={LoginPage} width="80%" alt="MatchMaker's login page is visible, with the MatchMaker logo up top, and below a field for a username and password. There is a button which says login below"/>
</div>
Enter your username and password in the corresponding fields and press “Login”! You will be greeted with the MatchMaker dashboard and ready to learn the first piece of this tutorial: [Building Described Collections](/usage/starting/collections/intro).
<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
<img src={MMDash} width="100%" alt="MatchMaker's dashboard is shown. There are four differently colored buttons: Browse & Describe, Create, Generate Report, and Administer"/>
