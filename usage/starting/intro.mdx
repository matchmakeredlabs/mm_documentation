# Welcome to MatchMaker
Thank you for joining MatchMaker on our mission to liberate learning! We're excited to introduce you to our platform and quickly get you up to speed!
## What is MatchMaker?
MatchMaker is revolutionary new technology enabling meaningful and reliable matches between learning assets, competency-based frameworks, and curriculums. MatchMaker has uses in higher education, hiring, personal skill growth, and much more! With MatchMaker, gone are days of wasting time relearning or sitting with uncertainty in knowledge!
## Let's Begin!
After you complete this ["Getting Started"](/usage/starting/intro) training, you may want to find gaps in your knowledge of MatchMaker. This may end up saving you loads of time digging through the thorough ["Functionality and Vocabulary"](/usage/vocab/intro) section you see on the left. Therefore, as a malevolent documentation writer, I'm going to use MatchMaker to make this process easy.
### Collections
MatchMaker's power is enabled by a novel and intuitive architecture for storing learning assets, competency-based frameworks, and curriculums. This architecture generalizes all of these items into what are known as __collections__. So, let's take this documentation and turn it into a collection!

But what makes these collections so special? Let's zoom in! */}
<img src={ElementsIntro} width="50%" alt="Inside each collection sits elements which are made up of two colors which mix to create the collection's color"/>
Here we can see this entire documentation organized into one large collection. Collections consist of elements, which are organized in a hierarchy. At the moment, I've only placed in one element, this particular page, which I've neatly organized under a "Getting Started" section. We can see this page has a particular color within the said collection: green. Notice, when we look closer, that this green is actually made up of a mix of blue and yellow. We can think of the overall color, green, representing exactly what it is that this introduction section teaches, but for example, we can split it up into two pieces: the basic causes of Matchmaker (blue), and an introduction to collections (yellow), which together make green. This is where the real magic of MatchMaker lies, as each element in any collection must be made of different components from what is called the Palet<sup style={{fontSize: 8}}>TM</sup>: the pallet can be thought of as a massive array of little pieces of material, which combined make up a full element's description of knowledge.
