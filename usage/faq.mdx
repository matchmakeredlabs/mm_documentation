A Palet Statement stands for an individual small piece of knowledge, such as: “Trees are made up of wood and leaves”. A Palet Key is a combination of Palet statements which describe a particular item. For example, to describe tree climbing, one may use a Palet statement for “Trees are made up of wood and leaves” and another Palet statement such as “Trees can be climbed using their branches”. Finally, the Palet is the full collection of all Palet statements, and where Palet statements are selected from. In essence, the Palet is where all the Palet statements are kept for use.

## 2. What’s the difference between a dependent and independent collection?
### Dependent Collections
Dependent collections can be thought of as the pool of knowledge you want to match to, in essence, what collections you want to search through. For example, if I was trying to switch careers and attempting to match certifications, my existing certifications and credentials could be considered dependent collections.
### Independent Collections
Independent collections can be thought of as the collections you want to query the dependent collections with and generate matches from. If dependent collections are a pool of knowledge, independent collections are more akin to a fishing rod. For example, building off of the prior career change example, the independent collections may be all the necessary job training and certifications needed for the new career you’d like to pursue. 

## 3. What’s the difference between sets and collections?
A collection is a particular learning resource, curriculum, or competency framework. A set may be a collection or a custom set. A custom set is simply a handpicked combination of elements from other collections.
## 4. What’s the difference between an organization and a group?
An organization is some sort of overarching group, company, or other sort of team on the MatchMaker platform. Meanwhile, a group is a set of users which exists under a particular organization. A group must exist within the organization which created it but can be added to any other organization after creation.
