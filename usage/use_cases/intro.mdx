# MatchMaker in Practice

In "MatchMaker in Practice", we will take a birds eye view of two fictional MatchMaker-enabled organizations; starting from an example end-user and then pivoting to the implementation process. 
1. In ["Transfer Students with MatchMaker"](/usage/use_cases/uni/intro), we will follow a transfer student, Sabrina, as she transfers to an international university. 
2. In ["Career Change with MatchMaker"](/usage/use_cases/career_change/intro), we will follow a nurse, Alex, at a career crossroads.
