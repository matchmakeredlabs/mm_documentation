# Introducing Sabrina
Sabrina, a recent recipient of an associates degree from a United States university, has decided to travel to the United Kingdom to complete her degree at the prestigious (and fictional) university of Bullford. She's just received an email from her new academic counselor, Audrey, inquiring about transferring her course credits over to Bullford. Instead of breaking out a mess of syllabi, Sabrina simply navigates to her United States university's MatchMaker-enabled portal.

Sabrina navigates to her university's courses page and searches for Bullford to send over her transcript. Then, since her institution and Bullford is MatchMaker-enabled, the coursework is sent in tandem with each course's MatchMaker collection.

Audrey, at Bullford, then receives Sabrina's transcript and rapidly recommends a personalized course plan for Sabrina, using Matchmaker to find gaps and matches in coursework.

Sabrina completes the recommend resources in the summer before her enrollment begins at Bullford and is able to hit the ground running, not needing to retake any coursework, and completes her degree a quarter early.
