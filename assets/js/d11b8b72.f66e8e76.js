In MatchMaker, this principle is applied to knowledge. Therefore, upon looking closer, this green is actually made up of a mix of blue and yellow. In essence, the overall color, green, represents exactly what this introduction section teaches, but the green has been split up into two pieces which combine to fully represent the whole.
